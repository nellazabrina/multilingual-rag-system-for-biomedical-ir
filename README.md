# Multilingual RAG System for Biomedical Information Retrieval

## Idea
In this project, we propose to develop a Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, specifically designed to retrieve biomedical research information. This system will be powered by several NLP techniques, including language detection & machine translation, question answering (QA), and RAG, using large language models (here we used `GPT3.5-Turbo`). By integrating these components, the system will provide comprehensive and relevant answers to user queries across multiple languages, enhancing the utility and accessibility of the search engine for a broader audience.

## What We Did
